# CODING ALONG A BOOK

This is a repo with the different algorithms presented in the book [Introduction to Algorithms ](https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262046305/introduction-to-algorithms/)

This repo is not meant to be used, it is just a playground for me to really try out zig, and re-learn some basic algos
